Hi there, Iâ€™m @TheGreatFool. I'm at a intermediate level of Python (maybe?) and beginner in Javascript (and HTML and CSS because I need these two to use Javascript in a browser)

Python is a treasure of my heart, my first programming language (well, actually I started with C++ but dropped it in a matter of weeks). Javascript seems interesting because I can create applications that work on **anything** that has a browser, awesome

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...well, I don't know yet, anything interesting I suppose
